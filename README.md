## VantageCoin
VantageCoin is a test bed for a 50+% casino.  Modern crypto casinos, at best, sit on the second layer with smart contracts.  Some even act like exchanges where they take ownership of all coins to be staked.  All bets are disadvantaged to provide profit to the house and they operate overseas with no oversight or legal protections.  VantageCoin aims to make them obsolete.

#### Vantage Difference
In real casinos, sometimes a player plays a game with odds better than 50%, the casino calls them "Advantaged Players".  These are the card counters and cheats, and the casinos don't want their business.

Vantage is short for advantaged, because every time VantageCoin is bet, it requires the rate of return be higher than 50%.  If a player bets enough times, they will make money.  The house always loses in the long run.

#### How is this Possible?
No business could run this way, just giving away money. However, a cryptocurrency can.  A cryptocurrency has to give away money if it wants to survive.  Bitcoin does that through mining, Etherium does that by offering up coins as collateral on promises.  Both processes end with brand new coins being minted.

VantageCoin mints new coins by covering bets placed by the users.  The users choose what the odds of a win are, and the payout is adjusted so the odds are perfectly fair, then adds a tiny bit extra.

#### An Example
Imagine a lottery with only 10 possibilities.  The user picks a number between 0 and 9 and if their number comes up, they get 10x their original bet, plus a tiny little bonus.  Because of how cryptocurrencies work, the coins that were bet would be tied up in a transaction for some time after the bet.  During that time, a lot of complex things need to happen

first thing, the original user packages their wager up in a block.  These blocks take a bunch of bets from a bunch of people and decide who wins and who loses.  They also decide what the payout will be based on a set formula, and how much the bonus will be based on how many people are playing at once.

The user also needs to check other blocks for authenticity to make sure nobody is cheating.  If someone is caught trying to cheat by lying about a block, they forfeit all the coins they put in.  That's why the system is trustworthy.  Everyone is either honest, or they lose everything.

Eventually, if the bet was a win, the coins come back to the user's wallet.  They can bet it again and the process starts over.

#### Roadmap
This project is young, and is not intended to ever be a functioning casino.  Although it is intended to operate with the full functionality, the coins will be "play coins" generated and replaced easily for the foreseeable future.

The current plan is to roll this out into a mobile lottery game.  A lottery makes sense to start because it doesn't demand that blocks be quickly validated, so even very little adoption would not affect the operation of a blockchain lottery.

Eventually as adoption increased, the game types could be expanded.  Small changes to casino game formats could make for some amazingly unique games.

#### Goals
This project has 3 goals.

1. Write a white paper - This problem is interesting to me, I believe the solution would be interesting to other people.  I want to write up any new ideas found during the development of this project in a white paper, because that's the traditional way to present innovations in blockchain technology

2. Disrupt lotteries and casinos - Though I don't think I will have the means to make this a functioning casino, someone else can take the work done here and offer 50+% odds.  No lottery or casino can match that, and if it works, it will provide a new option to problem gamblers that is less likely to end in disaster

3. Make new games - The process of taking a game and making it work with these restrictions is a totally separate issue that happens to result in some brand new experiences.  Gambling is inherently exciting to some people and a 50+% game allows and requires some improvements to the games that make them feel even better.
